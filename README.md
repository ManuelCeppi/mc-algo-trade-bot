This project is a just-for-fun project, for improving my python skills and, at the same time, having fun with Finance and investing in stocks, in general.
It's an AWS Lambda built with python, deployed through the serverless framework and by a GithubAction.
It integrates with different third party Software, like Alpaca (Broker), Financial modelling prep (Stocks data).
